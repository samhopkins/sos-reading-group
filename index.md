## SoS+TCS Reading Group

The SoS+TCS reading group is a once-monthly virtual reading group on recent papers in theoretical computer science, focusing primarily on the power and limitations of hierarchies of convex programs (like the *Sum of Squares hierarchy*) in algorithm design. We meet once per month, generally on the third Wednesday of the month.

We meet for 3 hour whiteboard/chalk/tablet talks, to allow lots of time for interaction and discussion with the speaker. **Everyone is welcome, and no question is too simple.** Contact the organizers to get on the mailing list for Zoom links.
