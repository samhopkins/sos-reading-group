## SoS+TCS Reading Group

The SoS+TCS reading group is a once-monthly virtual reading group on recent papers in theoretical computer science, focusing primarily on the power and limitations of hierarchies of convex programs (like the *Sum of Squares hierarchy*) in algorithm design.

**Format:** We meet for 3 hour whiteboard/chalk/tablet talks, to allow lots of time for interaction and discussion with the speaker. Sessions will have 1-2 coffee breaks. **Everyone is welcome, and no question is too simple.** Our format is inspired by the old [MIT/MSR Reading Group](http://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/reading-group/). Contact the organizers to get on the mailing list for Zoom links.

3 hours is a long time. It is **not rude** to leave at the first break, or even before.

**Date and Time:** By default, the 3rd Wednesday of every month, from 9am-12pm Pacific time. Schedule may vary from month to month.

**Organizers:** [Tselil Schramm](https://tselilschramm.org/) and [Sam Hopkins](http://www.samuelbhopkins.com/)

### Schedule, Winter/Spring 2021
